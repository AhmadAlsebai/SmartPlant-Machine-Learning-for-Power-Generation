Dataset Overview
The CCPP dataset contains data collected from a power plant, where the goal is to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (PE) based on four input variables:

AT (Ambient Temperature)
V (Exhaust Vacuum)
AP (Ambient Pressure)
RH (Relative Humidity)
The dataset consists of 9,568 rows and 5 columns (4 features + target variable PE).
